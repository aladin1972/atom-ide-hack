# atom-ide-hack

This plugin provides basic IDE support for Hack when using `atom-ide`; a
full-featured experience is available as part of [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io).

Atom-IDE and Nuclide are both currently unmaintained - we strongly recommend using Visual Studio Code and `vscode-hack` instead.

## Examples
